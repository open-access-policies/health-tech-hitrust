### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all **[Company Name]** workforce members, contractors, and third parties who create, process, store, or dispose of company information. It encompasses all information in any format (electronic, physical, audio, video) and storage medium (databases, file systems, email, backup media, cloud storage, paper documents, optical media). This policy covers all phases of the information lifecycle from creation through final disposition, including active use, archival storage, and secure destruction.

---

### 1. Objective

The objective of this policy is to establish comprehensive controls for managing privileged accounts and administrative access within **[Company Name]**'s information systems and infrastructure. This policy ensures that accounts with elevated privileges are subject to enhanced security controls, monitoring, and governance to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical systems and electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). This policy implements just-in-time access principles, enhanced authentication requirements, and comprehensive monitoring to minimize the risk associated with privileged account compromise.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all **[Company Name]** workforce members, contractors, and third parties who require elevated administrative privileges to perform their job functions. It encompasses all privileged accounts including system administrators, database administrators, cloud administrators, network administrators, security administrators, and service accounts with elevated privileges. This policy covers all systems and platforms including on-premises infrastructure, cloud services, applications, databases, network devices, and security tools. It applies to all environments (production, staging, development, testing) where privileged access is required.

### 3. Policy

Privileged accounts and administrative access shall be managed through rigorous controls that implement just-in-time access principles, enhanced authentication, comprehensive monitoring, and strict approval processes to minimize security risks.

#### 3.1 Principles of Privileged Access Management

Privileged access management shall be based on fundamental security principles that minimize risk and ensure accountability.

##### 3.1.1 Least Privilege and Separation of Duties

- **Minimal Privilege Assignment:** Privileged accounts shall be granted only the minimum level of access necessary to perform specific administrative functions. Broad administrative privileges shall be avoided in favor of granular, function-specific permissions.

- **Role-Based Privilege Assignment:** Privileged access shall be assigned based on clearly defined administrative roles with documented responsibilities and access requirements. Role definitions shall be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect current business needs.

- **Separation of Duties:** Critical administrative functions shall be divided among multiple individuals to prevent single points of failure and reduce the risk of unauthorized actions. No single individual shall have complete administrative control over critical systems.

- **Temporary Privilege Elevation:** Standard user accounts shall be used for routine activities, with privilege elevation requested only when administrative functions are required. Permanent assignment of elevated privileges shall be minimized.

##### 3.1.2 Enhanced Authentication and Authorization

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** All privileged accounts shall require multi-factor authentication using approved authentication methods. Hardware tokens or biometric authentication may be required for critical infrastructure access.

- **Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs):** Dedicated secured workstations shall be used for privileged access to critical systems, isolated from general-purpose computing activities.

- **Network-Based Access Controls:** Privileged access shall be restricted to authorized networks and locations, with additional controls for remote privileged access.

#### 3.2 Just-in-Time (JIT) Access Implementation

Privileged access shall be granted on a time-limited, just-in-time basis to minimize exposure and reduce the attack surface of elevated privileges.

##### 3.2.1 Time-Limited Access Sessions

- **Session Duration Limits:**
  - **Critical Infrastructure Access** (production databases, cloud administrative consoles): Maximum session duration of **[Duration, e.g., 4 hours]** with automatic termination
  - **Standard Administrative Access** (system administration, application management): Maximum session duration of **[Duration, e.g., 8 hours]** with renewal available
  - **Development and Testing Access**: Maximum session duration of **[Duration, e.g., 24 hours]** with self-service renewal

- **Automatic Session Termination:** Privileged access sessions shall automatically terminate upon expiration, with no automatic renewal. Users must request new access through established approval processes.

- **Emergency Access Procedures:** Break-glass access procedures shall be established for emergency situations, with enhanced monitoring and immediate notification requirements.

##### 3.2.2 Dynamic Access Approval

- **Request-Based Access:** Privileged access shall be requested through automated workflows with business justification and approval requirements. Standing privileged access shall be minimized.

- **Approval Workflows:** Access requests shall require approval from appropriate managers and security personnel based on the risk level and scope of requested privileges.

- **Access Reviews:** All active privileged access sessions shall be reviewed regularly to ensure continued business justification and appropriate usage.

#### 3.3 Privileged Account Provisioning and Management

Comprehensive processes shall govern the creation, modification, and termination of privileged accounts throughout their lifecycle.

##### 3.3.1 Privileged Account Management Implementation

- **Privileged Account Provisioning and Approval:**
  - Privileged account requests shall be submitted through **[Access Management System]** with business justification, required access level, and duration specification

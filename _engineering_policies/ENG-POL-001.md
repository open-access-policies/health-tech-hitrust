- **Development Phase:**
    - Secure coding standards shall be followed for all programming languages and frameworks used in software development.
    - Security-focused code reviews shall be conducted for all code changes to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
    - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools shall be integrated into the development process for automated vulnerability detection.
    - Dependency scanning shall be performed to identify vulnerable third-party components and libraries.
    - Security unit tests shall be developed and executed as part of the testing framework to validate security controls.

- **Testing Phase:**
    - Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) shall be performed on all applications before production deployment to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
    - Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) shall be implemented where technically feasible to provide real-time security feedback.
    - Penetration testing shall be conducted for all applications handling ePHI or Confidential data to validate security controls.
    - Security test cases shall validate proper implementation of security controls and requirements.
    - Vulnerability assessments shall be performed on the complete application stack to identify security weaknesses.

- **Deployment Phase:**
    - Security configuration reviews shall be conducted before production deployment to ensure secure system settings.
    - Infrastructure security scanning shall validate secure deployment configurations against established baselines.
    - Secrets management processes shall ensure secure handling of credentials and keys throughout deployment.
    - Production environment hardening shall be verified against security baselines before application release.
    - Security monitoring and logging shall be implemented for all production applications to enable threat detection.

- **Maintenance Phase:**
    - Regular security assessments shall be conducted on production applications to identify emerging vulnerabilities.
    - Security patches and updates shall be applied according to established timelines based on vulnerability severity.
    - Continuous monitoring shall detect and alert on security vulnerabilities and threats in production environments.
    - End-of-life procedures shall ensure secure decommissioning of applications and data when systems are retired.

##### 3.1.2 Security Gates and Approval Process

Security gates shall be implemented at key phases to ensure security requirements are met before proceeding:

- **Design Gate:** Security architecture review and threat model approval shall be required before proceeding to development.
- **Code Gate:** Static analysis results and code review approval shall be required before proceeding to testing.
- **Test Gate:** Dynamic testing results and penetration test approval shall be required before proceeding to deployment.
- **Deploy Gate:** Security configuration review and vulnerability scan approval shall be required before production release.
- **Production Gate:** Security monitoring implementation and incident response procedures shall be verified before full production deployment.

#### 3.2 Secure Coding and Testing Implementation

All secure coding practices, code review requirements, static analysis tools, and security testing methodologies shall be implemented as defined in the Secure Coding and Testing Policy (ENG-POL-005). This includes comprehensive secure coding standards for all programming languages and frameworks, mandatory code review processes, automated static and dynamic security testing, and regular penetration testing requirements.

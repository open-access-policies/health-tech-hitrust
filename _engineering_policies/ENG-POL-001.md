### 1. Objective

The objective of this policy is to establish a comprehensive framework for integrating security controls throughout the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) at **[Company Name]**. This policy ensures that security considerations are systematically incorporated into every phase of software development, from initial requirements gathering through deployment and maintenance. By implementing a structured secure development lifecycle framework and comprehensive security training programs, **[Company Name]** ensures that all software applications and systems are designed, developed, and maintained with appropriate security safeguards to protect electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) and maintain compliance with HIPAA, HITECH, and SOC 2 requirements.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all **[Company Name]** workforce members involved in software development activities, including developers, architects, testers, DevOps engineers, product managers, project managers, and security engineers. It encompasses all software development projects including new applications, system modifications, third-party integrations, mobile applications, web applications, APIs, and infrastructure-as-code. This policy covers all development methodologies (Agile, DevOps, Waterfall), deployment models (on-premises, cloud, hybrid), and development environments (development, testing, staging, production). It applies to both internally developed software and customizations of third-party applications, establishing the overarching framework that is implemented through the Secure Coding and Testing Policy (ENG-POL-005) and Third-Party Component Management Policy (ENG-POL-006).

### 3. Policy

    - Security configuration reviews shall be conducted before production deployment
    - Infrastructure security scanning shall validate secure deployment configurations
    - Secrets management processes shall ensure secure handling of credentials and keys
    - Production environment hardening shall be verified against security baselines
    - Security monitoring and logging shall be implemented for all production applications

- **Maintenance Phase:**
    - Regular security assessments shall be conducted on production applications
    - Security patches and updates shall be applied according to established timelines
    - Continuous monitoring shall detect and alert on security vulnerabilities
    - End-of-life procedures shall ensure secure decommissioning of applications and data

##### 3.1.2 Security Gates and Approval Process

Security gates shall be implemented at key phases to ensure security requirements are met before proceeding:

- **Design Gate:** Security architecture review and threat model approval required
- **Code Gate:** Static analysis results and code review approval required
- **Test Gate:** Dynamic testing results and penetration test approval required
- **Deploy Gate:** Security configuration review and vulnerability scan approval required
- **Production Gate:** Security monitoring implementation and incident response procedures verified

#### 3.2 Secure Coding and Testing Implementation

All secure coding practices, code review requirements, static analysis tools, and security testing methodologies shall be implemented as defined in the Secure Coding and Testing Policy (ENG-POL-005). This includes comprehensive secure coding standards for all programming languages and frameworks, mandatory code review processes, automated static and dynamic security testing, and regular penetration testing requirements.

#### 3.3 Third-Party Component and DevOps Security Management

All third-party component management, DevOps security practices, CI/CD pipeline security, and supply chain risk management shall be implemented as defined in the Third-Party Component Management Policy (ENG-POL-006). This includes automated dependency scanning, vendor security assessments, secure CI/CD pipeline implementation, secrets management, and comprehensive supply chain security controls.

#### 3.4 Security Training and Awareness

All development team members shall receive comprehensive security training appropriate to their roles and responsibilities.

##### 3.7.1 Developer Security Training

- **Initial Training Requirements:**
    - Secure coding training for all new developers within **[Timeframe, e.g., 30 days]** of hire
    - Language and framework-specific security training
    - OWASP Top 10 awareness and prevention techniques
    - Threat modeling and security design principles
    - Security tool usage and integration training

- **Ongoing Training and Awareness:**
    - Annual security training updates covering emerging threats and vulnerabilities
    - Specialized training for developers working on critical or high-risk applications
    - Security conference attendance and knowledge sharing
    - Internal security awareness presentations and workshops
    - Gamification and hands-on security challenges

##### 3.7.2 Security Champions Program

parent: Operational Procedures
nav_order: 4
---
### 1. Purpose

To provide step-by-step instructions for securely destroying or sanitizing different types of electronic media and physical documents to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.

### 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all company-owned and managed media, both electronic and physical, that contains company or customer data. This includes, but is not limited to, hard drives, solid-state drives (SSDs), USB drives, backup tapes, mobile devices, and paper documents.

### 3. Overview

This procedure outlines the mandated methods for disposing of or sanitizing media based on the classification level of the data it contains. It ensures that all sensitive information is rendered unrecoverable, in compliance with regulatory and industry standards.

### 4. Procedure

#### 4.1 Electronic Media (Hard Drives, SSDs)

| **Step** | **Who**                      | **What**                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**    | Asset Custodian / IT Team    | Identify media that is at the end of its lifecycle or is being decommissioned.                                                                                        |
| **2**    | IT Team                      | For media containing **Confidential** or **Restricted** data, perform cryptographic erasure according to NIST SP 800-88 guidelines.                                     |
| **3**    | IT Team                      | For media that cannot be cryptographically erased, or for media containing the most sensitive **Restricted** data, physically destroy the media (e.g., shredding, degaussing). |
| **4**    | IT Team                      | Document the disposal method, date, and personnel involved in the asset management system. If a third-party vendor is used, obtain and file a certificate of destruction. |

#### 4.2 Paper Documents

| **Step** | **Who**                      | **What**                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**    | All Employees                | Identify paper documents containing **Confidential** or **Restricted** information that are no longer required.                                                           |
| **2**    | All Employees                | Place documents in designated secure shredding bins provided throughout the office.                                                                                   |
| **3**    | Approved Disposal Vendor     | The approved vendor collects the contents of the shredding bins on a scheduled basis for secure, off-site destruction.                                                |
| **4**    | Facilities / IT Team         | Obtain and file the certificate of destruction provided by the vendor.                                                                                                |

### 5. Standards Compliance

This section maps the procedure steps to specific controls from relevant information security standards.

| **Procedure Step(s)** | **Standard/Framework**     | **Control Reference**        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **4.1-4.2**           | SOC 2                      | CC6.5                        |
| **4.1**               | NIST                       | SP 800-88                    |

### 6. Artifact(s)

A completed disposal record in the asset management system or a certificate of destruction from a third-party vendor.

### 7. Definitions

- **Cryptographic Erasure:** The process of using encryption software to render targeted data on a storage device unreadable.

- **Degaussing:** The process of reducing or eliminating an unwanted magnetic field (or data) stored on tape and disk media.

- **Physical Destruction:** The process of rendering media unusable and its data unrecoverable by physically altering it (e.g., shredding, pulverizing).

---
### 1. Purpose

To provide the technical steps for the secure generation, distribution, storage, rotation, and destruction of cryptographic keys.

### 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all cryptographic keys used to protect company and customer data, including keys used for data at rest and data in transit encryption. It applies to all personnel involved in the management of cryptographic keys.

### 3. Overview

This procedure outlines the secure lifecycle management of cryptographic keys, from generation to destruction. It ensures that all cryptographic keys are handled in a secure manner, using approved hardware security modules (HSMs) and secure channels, with all actions logged for audit purposes.

### 4. Procedure

#### 4.1 Key Generation

| **Step** | **Who**                      | **What**                                                                                                                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**    | Security Engineering Team    | Generate cryptographic keys using the company's approved Hardware Security Module (HSM) to ensure randomness and security.            |
| **2**    | Security Engineering Team    | Ensure key strength meets the requirements defined in the Encryption and Key Management Policy (e.g., AES-256 or stronger).           |
| **3**    | Security Engineering Team    | Log the generation event in the key management system, including the key identifier, generation time, and responsible personnel.      |

#### 4.2 Key Distribution

| **Step** | **Who**                      | **What**                                                                                                                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**    | Security Engineering Team    | Distribute keys to systems or services requiring them using secure, encrypted channels (e.g., TLS-protected connections).             |
| **2**    | Security Engineering Team    | Never transmit keys in plaintext or through insecure methods like email.                                                              |
| **3**    | Security Engineering Team    | Log the distribution event, noting the recipient system/service and timestamp.                                                        |

#### 4.3 Key Storage

| **Step** | **Who**                      | **What**                                                                                                                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**    | Security Engineering Team    | Store all cryptographic keys in the approved Hardware Security Module (HSM) or a secure, encrypted key vault.                           |
| **2**    | Security Engineering Team    | Implement strict access controls to the key storage system, limiting access to authorized personnel only.                               |
| **3**    | Security Engineering Team    | Ensure that key storage systems are physically and logically secured and monitored.                                                   |

#### 4.4 Key Rotation

| **Step** | **Who**                      | **What**                                                                                                                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**    | Security Engineering Team    | Rotate cryptographic keys at least annually, or more frequently if mandated by policy or regulation.                                  |
| **2**    | Security Engineering Team    | Generate a new key and securely distribute it to all relevant systems.                                                                |
| **3**    | Security Engineering Team    | Deactivate the old key but retain it in a secure state for a defined period to decrypt previously encrypted data if required.             |
| **4**    | Security Engineering Team    | Log the rotation event, including the identifiers for both the old and new keys.                                                      |

#### 4.5 Key Destruction

| **Step** | **Who**                      | **What**                                                                                                                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**    | Security Engineering Team    | When a key is no longer required and its retention period has expired, securely destroy it using the key management system's functions. |
| **2**    | Security Engineering Team    | Ensure the destruction process is irreversible (e.g., cryptographic erasure).                                                         |
| **3**    | Security Engineering Team    | Log the destruction event, including the key identifier and destruction timestamp.                                                    |

## About This Project

Navigating the complex landscape of health tech compliance can be challenging. The goal of this project is to provide a clear, comprehensive, and adaptable set of security policies that align with industry best practices and key regulatory frameworks. These templates are designed to be clear enough for non-technical stakeholders to understand while being robust enough to satisfy auditors.

## Getting Started

Each policy category contains both high-level policies that establish requirements and detailed procedures that provide implementation guidance. Policies are numbered for easy reference and cross-linking.

Start by reviewing the policies most relevant to your immediate needs, then work through the related procedures to understand implementation requirements.

## Download Complete Documentation

For convenience, all policies and procedures are also available as a comprehensive PDF document:

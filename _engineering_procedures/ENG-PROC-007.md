Ensure coverage of production, staging, development, and management networks. |
| **2** | Network Administrator | **Baseline Establishment**: Establish network traffic baselines for normal operations by collecting and analyzing **[Duration, e.g., 30 days]** of historical network data. Define normal traffic patterns, communication flows, and bandwidth utilization for different network segments and time periods. |
| **3** | Security Engineer | **Monitoring Rule Configuration**: Implement network monitoring rules to detect suspicious activities including: port scanning, network reconnaissance, lateral movement, data exfiltration, command and control communications, and protocol anomalies. Configure thresholds based on established baselines. |
| **4** | SOC Analyst | **Real-Time Traffic Monitoring**: Monitor network traffic dashboards continuously during business hours for anomalous patterns, suspicious connections, and policy violations. Review automated alerts generated by network monitoring systems within **[Timeframe, e.g., 5 minutes]** of generation. |
| **5** | SOC Analyst | **Network Alert Triage**: For network security alerts, perform initial analysis to determine alert validity and severity. Investigate source and destination IP addresses, protocols, ports, and traffic volumes. Cross-reference with threat intelligence feeds and known malicious indicators. |
| **6** | SOC Analyst | **Traffic Pattern Analysis**: Analyze network traffic for indicators of compromise including: unusual data transfer volumes, connections to suspicious external IP addresses, non-standard protocol usage, and traffic during off-hours. Document findings in the network monitoring system. |
| **7** | Network Administrator | **Network Performance Monitoring**: Monitor network infrastructure performance including bandwidth utilization, latency, packet loss, and device availability. Generate alerts for performance degradation that may indicate security issues or capacity problems. |
| **8** | Security Engineer | **DNS Monitoring and Analysis**: Monitor DNS queries for suspicious domains, data exfiltration through DNS tunneling, command and control communications, and domain generation algorithm (DGA) patterns. Implement DNS filtering for known malicious domains. |
| **9** | SOC Analyst | **Lateral Movement Detection**: Monitor for signs of lateral movement including: authentication attempts across multiple systems, privileged account usage from unusual locations, SMB and RDP traffic patterns, and credential reuse indicators. |
| **10** | Security Engineer | **Network Behavior Analysis**: Implement behavioral analysis to identify deviations from normal network patterns including: new communication paths, unusual application traffic, bandwidth consumption anomalies, and protocol violations. |
| **11** | Network Administrator | **VPN and Remote Access Monitoring**: Monitor VPN connections and remote access activities including: connection attempts, authentication failures, geographic location anomalies, and simultaneous connections from different locations for the same user. |
| **12** | SOC Analyst | **Incident Escalation**: For confirmed network security incidents, escalate to the Incident Response Team per RES-PROC-001. Provide network evidence including traffic captures, flow logs, and analysis results to support incident investigation. |
| **13** | Network Administrator | **Log Collection and Retention**: Ensure network monitoring data is collected, stored, and retained according to SEC-POL-009 requirements. Configure automated log forwarding to centralized SIEM system with appropriate retention periods. |
| **14** | Security Engineer | **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Integrate external threat intelligence feeds with network monitoring systems to automatically detect known malicious IP addresses, domains, and network signatures. Update threat intelligence sources regularly. |
| **15** | Network Administrator | **Monitoring System Maintenance**: Perform regular maintenance of network monitoring infrastructure including: sensor health checks, software updates, configuration backups, and capacity planning. Ensure **[Percentage, e.g., 99.5%]** uptime for critical monitoring systems. |
| **16** | Security Engineer | **Weekly Threat Hunt**: Conduct weekly proactive threat hunting activities focused on network indicators including: reviewing network connections to new external destinations, analyzing traffic patterns for hidden channels, and investigating anomalous protocol usage. |
| **17** | SOC Analyst | **Monthly Network Security Review**: Generate monthly reports of network security events, threat trends, monitoring system performance, and improvement recommendations. Review with Security Officer and Network team for program optimization. |

### 1. Purpose

This procedure establishes comprehensive processes for managing, configuring, and maintaining firewall systems to provide network security controls and enforce network access policies. These procedures support the Infrastructure Security Policy (ENG-POL-003) and ensure effective implementation of HITRUST CSF v11.2.0 Domain 08 - Network Protection controls through proper firewall administration.

### 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all Network Security Engineers, Firewall Administrators, and Infrastructure Security team members responsible for configuring, maintaining, and monitoring firewall systems across **[Company Name]**'s network infrastructure, including cloud security groups, on-premises firewalls, and web application firewalls.

### 3. Overview

Firewall management encompasses the complete lifecycle of firewall systems including initial deployment, rule configuration, ongoing maintenance, performance monitoring, and security policy enforcement. This procedure defines standardized processes for maintaining effective firewall protection while ensuring proper change control and documentation.

### 4. Procedure

| **Step** | **Who** | **What** |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| **1** | Network Security Engineer | **Firewall Architecture Design**: Design firewall deployment architecture to provide defense-in-depth protection including: perimeter firewalls, internal segmentation firewalls, web application firewalls (WAF), and cloud security groups. Document firewall placement and security zones. |
| **2** | Firewall Administrator | **Initial Configuration**: Configure new firewall systems with baseline security policies including: default deny rules, administrative access controls, logging configuration, high availability settings, and integration with management systems. |
| **3** | Network Security Engineer | **Security Zone Definition**: Define and implement network security zones including: Internet, DMZ, Internal, Management, and High-Security zones. Configure firewall rules to enforce zone-based access controls and traffic flow restrictions. |
| **4** | Firewall Administrator | **Rule Development Process**: For new firewall rule requests, validate business justification, assess security risk, design specific rule parameters (source, destination, service, action), and document rule purpose and expiration date. |
| **5** | Security Officer | **Rule Approval Workflow**: Review and approve firewall rule requests based on security policy compliance, risk assessment, and business necessity. Require additional approvals for high-risk rules (external access, privileged ports, broad access). |
| **6** | Firewall Administrator | **Rule Implementation**: Implement approved firewall rules using standardized naming conventions, documentation requirements, and testing procedures. Verify rule placement and precedence to ensure correct policy enforcement. |
| **7** | Firewall Administrator | **Change Documentation**: Document all firewall changes including: change request reference, implementation date, rule details, testing results, and rollback procedures. Maintain configuration version control and change history. |
| **8** | Network Security Engineer | **Rule Testing and Validation**: Test new firewall rules to verify correct functionality, confirm intended traffic is allowed, ensure unauthorized traffic is blocked, and validate no unintended impacts on network operations. |
| **9** | SOC Analyst | **Firewall Log Monitoring**: Monitor firewall logs continuously for security events including: blocked connection attempts, policy violations, administrative access, and system health alerts. Investigate suspicious activities within defined timeframes. |
| **10** | Firewall Administrator | **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor firewall system performance including: throughput utilization, session capacity, CPU and memory usage, and high availability status. Ensure systems maintain **[Percentage, e.g., 99%]** availability. |
| **11** | Network Security Engineer | **Quarterly Rule Review**: Conduct quarterly review of all firewall rules to identify: unused or expired rules, overly permissive access, rules requiring updated justification, and opportunities for rule consolidation or optimization. |
| **12** | Firewall Administrator | **Rule Cleanup and Optimization**: Remove expired, unused, or unnecessary firewall rules based on quarterly review findings. Consolidate similar rules and optimize rule order for improved performance and management. |
| **13** | Firewall Administrator | **Backup and Recovery**: Perform regular configuration backups of all firewall systems. Test backup restoration procedures quarterly and maintain offsite backup storage. Document recovery procedures for different failure scenarios. |
| **14** | Network Security Engineer | **Security Policy Updates**: Update firewall security policies based on: new threats and vulnerabilities, business requirement changes, compliance requirement updates, and security incident lessons learned. |
| **15** | Firewall Administrator | **System Maintenance**: Perform regular firewall system maintenance including: software updates, security patches, firmware upgrades, and hardware maintenance. Schedule maintenance during approved change windows with proper testing. |
| **16** | SOC Analyst | **Incident Response Support**: For security incidents involving network traffic, provide firewall logs, configuration details, and implement emergency blocking rules as directed by Incident Response Team per RES-PROC-001. |
| **17** | Network Security Engineer | **Annual Security Assessment**: Conduct annual comprehensive firewall security assessment including: rule effectiveness review, security architecture validation, compliance verification, and penetration testing coordination. |

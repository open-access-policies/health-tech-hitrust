# Wireless Network Security Monitoring Procedures (ENG-PROC-011)

## 1. Purpose

This procedure establishes comprehensive monitoring and security controls for wireless network infrastructure to detect unauthorized access points, rogue devices, and security threats. This procedure ensures continuous oversight of wireless communications that may handle electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) and maintains compliance with security frameworks requiring wireless network protection and monitoring.

## 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all wireless network infrastructure, devices, and communications within **[Company Name]** facilities and remote locations, including:
- Corporate wireless access points and wireless local area networks (WLANs)
- Guest wireless networks and visitor access systems
- Wireless network monitoring and detection systems
- Mobile device wireless connections and hotspot usage
- Bluetooth, near-field communication (NFC), and other short-range wireless technologies
- Wireless network management and administration systems

## 3. Overview

Wireless network security monitoring requires continuous surveillance for unauthorized access points, rogue devices, and security threats. This includes real-time monitoring of wireless traffic, regular scanning for security vulnerabilities, and immediate response to detected threats. All wireless monitoring activities must be documented and integrated with the organization's overall security incident response capabilities.

## 4. Procedure

| **Step** | **Who** | **What** |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| **1** | **Network Security Analyst** | Deploy wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS) sensors throughout all **[Company Name]** facilities with **[Coverage Percentage, e.g., 95%]** coverage |
| **2** | **Network Security Analyst** | Configure WIDS to monitor all wireless frequencies including 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and **[Additional Frequencies, e.g., 6GHz]** for comprehensive coverage |
| **3** | **Network Security Analyst** | Establish baseline inventory of authorized wireless access points, including MAC addresses, locations, SSIDs, and security configurations |
| **4** | **Network Security Analyst** | Configure automated alerts for detection of unauthorized access points, evil twin attacks, wireless deauthentication attacks, and rogue devices |
| **5** | **Security Operations Center** | Monitor wireless security dashboard continuously during business hours and via automated monitoring during off-hours |
| **6** | **Security Operations Center** | Investigate all wireless security alerts within **[Duration, e.g., 15 minutes]** of detection and escalate high-severity threats immediately |
| **7** | **Network Security Analyst** | Perform daily wireless site surveys to identify unauthorized access points, signal interference, and coverage gaps |
| **8** | **Network Security Analyst** | Conduct weekly vulnerability scans of all authorized wireless access points using **[Scanning Tools, e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS]** |
| **9** | **Network Security Analyst** | Review wireless access logs daily for suspicious connection patterns, failed authentication attempts, and data exfiltration indicators |
| **10** | **Incident Response Team** | For confirmed rogue access points, immediately initiate containment by blocking the device and investigating potential data compromise |
| **11** | **Network Security Analyst** | Perform monthly wireless penetration testing to validate security controls and identify configuration weaknesses |
| **12** | **Network Security Analyst** | Generate weekly wireless security reports including threat detection statistics, vulnerability findings, and remediation status |
| **13** | **Network Security Manager** | Review monthly wireless security metrics including mean time to detection (MTTD) and mean time to response (MTTR) for threats |
| **14** | **Network Security Manager** | Conduct quarterly review of wireless security architecture and update detection rules based on emerging threat intelligence |
| **15** | **Compliance Officer** | Maintain wireless monitoring logs and incident documentation for minimum **[Retention Period, e.g., 3 years]** for audit compliance |
| **16** | **Information Security Officer** | Review quarterly wireless security assessments and approve changes to monitoring procedures and detection capabilities |
| **17** | **Network Security Manager** | Update wireless device inventory monthly and remove decommissioned devices from monitoring systems and security baselines |

## 5. Standards Compliance

This procedure addresses the following regulatory and compliance requirements:

### 1. Purpose

The purpose of this procedure is to outline the expedited process for authorizing, deploying, and retrospectively documenting an emergency change to resolve a critical issue, such as a service outage or a severe security vulnerability.

### 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all emergency changes required to restore service, fix a critical security flaw, or address an urgent operational issue in the production environment.

### 3. Overview

This procedure defines the workflow for emergency changes. It starts with the identification of a critical issue, followed by obtaining expedited approvals, performing a focused review, deploying the fix, and conducting a formal post-mortem review to ensure proper documentation is completed after the fact.

| **3**    | Engineer / Peer Reviewer     | An expedited peer and security review is performed on the proposed change to ensure it is a targeted and necessary fix.                                              |
| **4**    | Engineer                     | Deploys the approved change to the production environment to resolve the critical issue.                                                                           |

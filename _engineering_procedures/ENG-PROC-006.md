title: Automated Privileged Access Management Procedure (ENG-PROC-006)
parent: Engineering Procedures
nav_order: 6
---

### 1. Purpose

The purpose of this procedure is to implement automated privileged access management using role-based access control (RBAC) and just-in-time (JIT) access, replacing manual quarterly reviews with continuous monitoring and exception-based access validation.

### 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all privileged access to production infrastructure, cloud services, and critical systems through automated identity and access management systems integrated with HR data and organizational roles.

### 3. Overview

This procedure leverages automated RBAC systems, just-in-time access controls, and exception-based monitoring to ensure privileged access is appropriately managed without manual quarterly disruptions. The approach emphasizes automation, self-service access requests, and anomaly detection over manual attestation processes.

### 4. Procedure

| **Step** | **Who** | **What** |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| **1** | IT Operations Team | Configure identity management system to automatically synchronize employee data including role, department, manager, and employment status from HR systems. Enable real-time updates for role changes and terminations. |
| **2** | Security Officer | Define standard privileged access roles based on job functions and map each role to specific cloud resources and permission sets using infrastructure as code. |
| **3** | Platform Engineer | Configure automated role assignment based on HR data and job function. Implement rules that automatically grant appropriate privileged access when employees are hired or change roles. |
| **4** | IT Operations Team | Implement group-based access control where privileged permissions are assigned to groups rather than individual users based on organizational status. |
| **5** | Platform Engineer | Configure cloud-native JIT access solutions to provide temporary elevated access with automatic expiration. Set default access duration to **[Duration, e.g., 4-8 hours]**. |
| **6** | DevOps Engineer | Implement self-service portal where engineers can request temporary privileged access with business justification and automated approval workflows. |
| **7** | Security Officer | Configure emergency break-glass access procedures for critical system outages with automatic expiration within **[Duration, e.g., 2-4 hours]**. |
| **8** | Platform Engineer | Configure session recording and monitoring for all privileged access sessions with automated analysis of privileged activities. |
| **9** | Security Officer | Configure cloud-native access analytics tools to continuously monitor privileged access patterns with machine learning-based anomaly detection. |
| **10** | IT Operations Team | Configure real-time alerting for privileged access anomalies and integrate alerts with security monitoring systems. |
| **11** | Platform Engineer | Implement automated monthly validation of privileged access assignments against current HR data and generate exception reports. |
| **12** | Security Officer | Conduct targeted access reviews only for high-risk exceptions identified by automated monitoring rather than comprehensive quarterly reviews. |

### 5. Standards Compliance

This procedure is designed to comply with and support the following industry standards and regulations.

| **4.1** | HITRUST CSF v11.2.0 | 02.b - Information Security Roles and Responsibilities |
| **All** | SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria | CC6.1 - Logical Access Security |
| **4.3** | SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria | CC6.2 - Access Management |
| **4.1-4.6** | HIPAA Security Rule | 45 CFR ยง 164.308(a)(4) - Information Access Management |
| **4.3** | NIST Cybersecurity Framework | PR.AC-4 - Access Permissions Management |
| **4.2** | NIST Cybersecurity Framework | PR.AC-6 - Identity and Credential Management |

### 6. Artifact(s)

- Automated access control logs and audit trails from cloud provider services
- Monthly exception reports showing access anomalies and remediation actions
- JIT access request and approval logs with business justifications
- Automated compliance dashboards showing access control effectiveness
- Break-glass access logs and post-incident review documentation

### 7. Definitions

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Access control method that assigns permissions to users based on their organizational roles rather than individual identity.

- **Just-In-Time (JIT) Access:** Security approach that provides temporary elevated access for specific tasks with automatic expiration.

- **Exception-Based Monitoring:** Monitoring approach that focuses on identifying and alerting on deviations from normal patterns rather than comprehensive periodic reviews.

- **Break-Glass Access:** Emergency access procedure that allows bypassing normal access controls during critical incidents with comprehensive logging and review.

- **Workload Identity:** Cloud-native identity management for applications and services that eliminates the need for static credentials.

### 8. Responsibilities

| **Role** | **Responsibility** |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| **Security Officer** | Define RBAC policies, configure anomaly detection rules, oversee JIT access procedures, and review high-risk access exceptions. |
| **IT Operations Team** | Configure and maintain identity management systems, monitor access analytics, respond to access anomalies, and manage automated provisioning. |
| **Platform Engineer** | Implement JIT access systems, configure cloud access controls, manage service account automation, and optimize privilege assignments. |
| **DevOps Engineer** | Integrate access controls into CI/CD pipelines, manage service account lifecycle, implement session recording, and automate credential rotation. |
| **Managers** | Approve exception-based access requests, validate access during role changes, and support incident response access procedures. |

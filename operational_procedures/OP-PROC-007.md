# Employee Onboarding and Offboarding Security Procedure (OP-PROC-007)

### 1. Purpose

To provide a formal checklist and process to ensure all security-related tasks are consistently and verifiably completed during employee onboarding and termination.

### 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all new and departing employees, contractors, and temporary staff. It involves the Human Resources (HR) department, the IT department, and the hiring manager.

### 3. Overview

This procedure establishes standardized checklists for the security-related aspects of employee onboarding and offboarding.

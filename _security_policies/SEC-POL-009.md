### 1. Objective

The objective of this policy is to establish the comprehensive audit logging framework and coordination requirements for **[Company Name]**'s information systems to ensure security events are captured, protected, and analyzed in support of incident detection, forensic analysis, and regulatory compliance. This policy provides the overarching framework for audit logging and coordinates the specialized logging requirements defined in SEC-POL-010 (Authentication and Network Audit Logging Policy) and SEC-POL-011 (Data Access and Compliance Audit Logging Policy). This framework ensures that appropriate audit trails are maintained to support the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets and electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) in compliance with HIPAA, HITECH, SOC 2, and HITRUST CSF v11.2.0 requirements.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all **[Company Name]** information systems, applications, network devices, security tools, and cloud services that process, store, or transmit company information or ePHI. This includes all production, staging, development, and administrative systems, as well as any third-party systems that process company data. All workforce members, contractors, and third parties with access to company systems are subject to the monitoring and logging requirements defined in this policy and its associated specialized policies SEC-POL-010 and SEC-POL-011.

### 3. Policy

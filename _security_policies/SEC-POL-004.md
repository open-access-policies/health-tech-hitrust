### 1. Objective

The objective of this policy is to establish a comprehensive framework for classifying, handling, and protecting **[Company Name]**'s information assets based on their sensitivity, value, and regulatory requirements. This policy ensures that appropriate security controls are applied consistently across all information types, with particular emphasis on protecting electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) and other sensitive data in accordance with HIPAA, HITECH, and SOC 2 requirements.

### 2. Scope

This policy applies to all **[Company Name]** workforce members, including employees, contractors, temporary staff, and third parties who create, access, process, store, transmit, or dispose of company information. It encompasses all information in any format (electronic, physical, or verbal) and at any location (on-premises, cloud, mobile devices, or third-party facilities). This policy covers the entire information lifecycle from creation to secure disposal.

### 3. Policy

All **[Company Name]** information shall be classified according to its sensitivity level and handled in accordance with established security controls that protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

#### 3.1 Information Classification Framework

- **[Company Name]** shall use a four-tier classification system to categorize all information assets:

- **Public:** Information that can be freely shared with the general public without risk to **[Company Name]** or its stakeholders.
    - Examples: Marketing materials, public website content, published research, press releases
    - No special handling requirements beyond standard business practices

- **Internal:** Information intended for use within **[Company Name]** that should not be disclosed to external parties without authorization.
    - Examples: Internal policies, organizational charts, general business communications, non-sensitive system documentation
    - Requires basic access controls and confidentiality agreements

- **Confidential:** Sensitive information that could cause significant harm to **[Company Name]**, its customers, or business partners if disclosed without authorization.
    - Examples: Financial records, strategic plans, customer lists, proprietary technology, employee personal information
    - Requires enhanced security controls, encryption for transmission, and formal access approval

- **Restricted:** Highly sensitive information that could cause severe harm if disclosed and is subject to regulatory protection requirements.
    - Examples: ePHI, payment card data, social security numbers, authentication credentials, encryption keys
    - Requires maximum security controls, encryption at rest and in transit, audit logging, and compliance with specific regulations

#### 3.2 Information Classification Responsibilities

Information classification shall be assigned by designated information owners and applied consistently throughout the information lifecycle. The Security Officer shall maintain an Information Asset Inventory that documents all major information assets, their designated Information Owner, and their classification level.

- Information owners are responsible for the initial classification of data for which they are responsible, approving access requests, and ensuring data is handled according to this policy.

- Classification shall be assigned at the time of creation or acquisition and documented in the Information Asset Inventory.

- When information of different classification levels is combined, the resulting information shall be classified at the highest level of any component.

- Information owners shall review the classification of their information assets at least annually. This review shall be documented to provide an audit trail.

**Document Classification**: Internal Use Only  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Effective Date**: **[Date]**  
**Review Date**: **[Annual Review Date]**  
**Document Owner**: **[Information Security Officer]**

## 1. Purpose

This procedure establishes comprehensive management controls for privileged accounts with elevated access to systems containing electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) and critical business systems. This procedure ensures privileged accounts are properly provisioned, monitored, and controlled to minimize security risks while maintaining operational capabilities for authorized administrative functions.

## 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all privileged accounts within **[Company Name]** systems and infrastructure, including:
- Administrative accounts for servers, databases, and network devices
- Application administrator accounts and service accounts
- Cloud platform administrative accounts (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Emergency access accounts and break-glass procedures
- Vendor and contractor privileged access accounts
- System service accounts and automated process accounts

## 3. Overview

Privileged account management requires strict controls for account creation, access approval, monitoring, and periodic review. This includes multi-factor authentication, privileged access management (PAM) solutions, session recording, and comprehensive audit logging. All privileged account activities must be monitored and reviewed to detect unauthorized usage and ensure compliance with security policies.

## 4. Procedure

| **15** | **System Administrator** | Rotate privileged account passwords quarterly using **[Password Management System]** with **[Complexity Requirements, e.g., 20+ characters]** |
| **16** | **Compliance Officer** | Maintain privileged account audit logs and session recordings for minimum **[Retention Period, e.g., 7 years]** for regulatory compliance |
| **17** | **Information Security Officer** | Generate annual privileged access risk assessment and update access controls based on threat landscape and business requirements |

### 1. Purpose

To define the process for automated monitoring and exception-based review of user access rights to ensure adherence to the principle of least privilege while minimizing administrative overhead through automation and intelligent alerting.

### 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all user accounts with access to company information systems, automated identity and access management systems, and the Security Officer and managers responsible for responding to access anomaly alerts.

### 3. Overview

This procedure describes the automated approach to access monitoring and exception-based reviews that replace traditional manual quarterly access reviews. It utilizes role-based access control (RBAC), automated anomaly detection, and targeted reviews triggered by specific events or risk indicators, ensuring compliance while enabling operational efficiency for a growing organization.

### 4. Procedure

| **Step** | **Who** | **What** |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| **1** | Platform Engineer | **Automated RBAC Configuration**: Configure identity and access management (IAM) systems to automatically assign access based on job roles, department, and manager hierarchy integrated with HR systems. Ensure role definitions align with job functions and are automatically updated when employees change positions. |
| **2** | Security Officer | **Access Monitoring Rules Setup**: Configure automated monitoring rules to detect access anomalies including: accounts with no login activity for **[Duration, e.g., 90 days]**, privilege escalation events, access from unusual locations, and users with access beyond their role requirements. |
| **3** | DevOps Engineer | **Automated Alert Configuration**: Set up automated alerts for access anomalies that require review: dormant accounts, excessive privileges, failed access attempts, and role misalignments. Configure alert thresholds to minimize false positives while maintaining security visibility. |
| **4** | IAM System | **Daily Automated Monitoring**: Automated systems continuously monitor user access patterns, login activities, and privilege usage. Generate daily reports on access anomalies and potential security risks without requiring manual intervention. |
| **5** | Security Officer | **Weekly Anomaly Review**: Review weekly automated reports of access anomalies and security alerts. Investigate high-priority alerts within **[Timeframe, e.g., 3 business days]** and coordinate with managers for access validation or remediation. |
| **6** | Manager/System Owner | **Exception-Based Review Response**: When alerted about access anomalies for their team members or systems, review and validate access requirements within **[Timeframe, e.g., 5 business days]**. Approve continued access or request access modification through automated workflows. |
| **7** | Platform Engineer | **Automated Access Remediation**: Implement automated access remediation for common scenarios: disable dormant accounts after **[Duration, e.g., 120 days]** of inactivity, remove access for terminated employees, and adjust access based on role changes automatically synced from HR systems. |
| **8** | Security Officer | **Risk-Based Targeted Reviews**: Conduct targeted access reviews for high-risk scenarios: **Critical Systems** (ePHI, production databases): Semi-annual automated reviews with manager attestation. **Privileged Accounts**: Quarterly automated validation with usage analysis. **Third-Party Access**: Event-driven reviews when contracts change or security incidents occur. |
| **9** | Platform Engineer | **Compliance Reporting**: Generate automated compliance reports showing access control effectiveness, review completion rates, remediation actions, and audit trail documentation for regulatory requirements. |
| **10** | Security Officer | **Quarterly Program Assessment**: Assess the effectiveness of automated access monitoring, review alert accuracy and response times, and optimize automation rules to reduce false positives while maintaining security coverage. |

### 5. Automated Monitoring and Alerting

#### 5.1 Access Anomaly Detection

**Dormant Account Monitoring:**
- Accounts with no login activity for **[Duration, e.g., 90 days]**: Automatic alert to manager
- Accounts with no login activity for **[Duration, e.g., 120 days]**: Automatic account suspension
- Privileged accounts with no activity for **[Duration, e.g., 60 days]**: Immediate security review

**Privilege Anomaly Detection:**
- Users with access beyond their defined role: Automatic manager notification
- Recent privilege escalation without approval: Immediate security investigation
- Multiple failed access attempts: Automatic account lockout and security alert

**Geographic and Behavioral Anomalies:**
- Access from unusual geographic locations: Real-time security alert
- Access during unusual hours for user's time zone: Automated logging and review
- Simultaneous access from multiple locations: Immediate investigation trigger

#### 5.2 Role-Based Access Automation

**HR System Integration:**
- Automatic role assignment based on job title and department
- Automatic access adjustment when employees change roles
- Automatic access revocation upon employment termination
- Manager hierarchy updates automatically adjust approval workflows

**Self-Service Access Requests:**
- Employees can request additional access through automated workflows
- Manager approval required for access outside standard role permissions
- Automatic access expiration for temporary access requests
- Audit trail maintained for all access requests and approvals

### 6. Exception-Based Review Triggers

#### 6.1 High-Priority Review Triggers

**Immediate Review Required:**
- Security incident involving user account compromise
- Privilege escalation without proper approval
- Access from sanctioned geographic locations
- Multiple failed authentication attempts indicating potential brute force

**Weekly Review Required:**
- Dormant privileged accounts
- Users with access to multiple high-risk systems
- Recent access pattern changes indicating potential insider threat
- Third-party accounts with extended access beyond contract terms

#### 6.2 Scheduled Review Requirements

**Semi-Annual Reviews (High-Risk Systems):**
- ePHI access and healthcare data systems
- Financial systems and payment processing
- Production infrastructure and administrative consoles
- Customer data and personally identifiable information (PII) systems

**Annual Reviews (Standard Systems):**
- Internal business applications and productivity tools
- Development and testing environments
- Non-sensitive internal systems and knowledge management
- Historical access validation for compliance documentation

### 7. Automated Remediation Actions

#### 7.1 Immediate Automated Actions

**Account Security Responses:**
- Lock accounts after **[Number, e.g., 5]** failed login attempts
- Suspend dormant accounts automatically after defined thresholds
- Revoke access for terminated employees within **[Timeframe, e.g., 2 hours]**
- Reset passwords for accounts showing signs of compromise

**Access Right Adjustments:**
- Remove excessive privileges not aligned with user roles
- Automatically expire temporary access grants
- Adjust access based on role changes from HR system updates
- Disable shared or service accounts not used within defined periods

#### 7.2 Manager-Assisted Remediation

**Access Validation Workflows:**
- Send access validation requests to managers for anomalous access
- Require manager approval for privilege escalation requests
- Escalate unresolved access anomalies to Security Officer
- Document manager decisions for audit trail and compliance

### 10. Definitions

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Access control method that restricts system access based on pre-defined roles within an organization.

**Access Anomaly:** Deviation from normal access patterns that may indicate security risks or policy violations.

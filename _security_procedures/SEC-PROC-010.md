### 1. Purpose

This procedure establishes processes for monitoring, analyzing, and responding to security events captured in audit logs through cloud-native tools and managed security service providers. These procedures support the Audit Logging and Monitoring Policy (SEC-POL-009) and ensure timely detection, investigation, and response to security incidents while maintaining compliance with HIPAA, SOC 2, and HITRUST CSF v11.2.0 requirements.

### 2. Scope

This procedure applies to the Security Officer, Platform Engineers, DevOps Engineers, and designated on-call personnel responsible for coordinating with managed security service providers and responding to escalated security alerts from **[Company Name]**'s information systems, applications, and cloud services.

### 3. Overview

Log monitoring and analysis leverages cloud-native security analytics, automated threat detection, and managed security service providers to provide continuous monitoring of security events. This approach eliminates the need for dedicated internal SOC operations while maintaining comprehensive security event monitoring and incident response capabilities appropriate for a **[Number, e.g., 120]**-person organization.

### 4. Procedure

| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| **1** | Platform Engineer | **Cloud Log Analytics Setup**: Configure cloud-native log analytics services (AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, GCP Cloud Logging) to centralize and analyze security logs from all systems. Enable automated threat detection and anomaly analysis capabilities. |
| **2** | DevOps Engineer | **Automated Alert Configuration**: Configure automated alerting for security events including: failed authentication attempts, privilege escalation, unusual data access patterns, and compliance violations. Set appropriate thresholds to minimize false positives. |
| **3** | Security Officer | **MSSP SIEM Integration**: Integrate cloud log sources with managed security service provider's SIEM platform for 24/7 monitoring and expert analysis. Ensure proper data retention and compliance with regulatory requirements. |
| **4** | Platform Engineer | **Log Source Configuration**: Ensure all critical systems forward security logs to centralized logging platform including: application servers, databases, authentication systems, network devices, and cloud service audit logs. |
| **5** | MSSP SOC Analyst | **Continuous Monitoring**: MSSP provides 24/7 monitoring of security events and automated alert triage. Performs initial analysis of security alerts and escalates confirmed threats according to established service level agreements. |
| **6** | MSSP SOC Analyst | **Alert Analysis and Classification**: MSSP security analysts perform detailed analysis of security events, correlate with threat intelligence, and classify threats by severity. Provide initial incident assessment and recommended response actions. |
| **7** | Security Officer | **Escalation Response Coordination**: Coordinate response to escalated security incidents from MSSP including: review of analysis findings, authorization of containment actions, and activation of internal incident response procedures per RES-PROC-001. |
| **8** | DevOps Engineer | **Automated Response Implementation**: Implement automated response capabilities for common security events including: account lockouts for failed authentication, automatic scaling during attacks, and isolation of compromised resources. |
| **9** | Platform Engineer | **Compliance Monitoring**: Configure automated compliance monitoring for HIPAA, SOC 2, and HITRUST requirements including: ePHI access logging, administrative action monitoring, and privileged account usage tracking. |
| **10** | On-Call Engineer | **After-Hours Response**: Provide after-hours response to critical security escalations from MSSP. Perform initial containment actions and coordinate with Security Officer during business hours for incident response. |
| **11** | Security Officer | **Weekly Security Review**: Review weekly security reports from MSSP and cloud security services including: threat trends, blocked attacks, compliance events, and service performance metrics. |
| **12** | MSSP Account Manager | **Monthly Service Review**: MSSP provides monthly executive reports including: security event analysis, threat intelligence updates, compliance status, and recommendations for security program improvements. |

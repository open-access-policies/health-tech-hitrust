### 1. Purpose

This procedure establishes standardized processes for monitoring, analyzing, and responding to security events captured in audit logs across **[Company Name]**'s information systems. These procedures support the Audit Logging and Monitoring Policy (SEC-POL-009) and ensure timely detection, investigation, and response to security incidents while maintaining compliance with HIPAA, SOC 2, and HITRUST CSF v11.2.0 requirements.

### 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all Security Team members, System Administrators, and Incident Response Team members responsible for monitoring and analyzing audit logs from **[Company Name]**'s information systems, applications, network devices, and cloud services.

### 3. Overview

The Security Operations Center (SOC) function, whether internal or outsourced, provides continuous monitoring of security events through the centralized SIEM system. This procedure defines the roles, responsibilities, and specific steps for log monitoring, alert triage, incident escalation, and periodic log analysis activities.

### 4. Procedure

| **Step** | **Who** | **What** |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| **1** | SOC Analyst | **Daily Shift Handover**: Review outstanding alerts from previous shift, check system health dashboards, and verify all monitoring systems are operational. Document any ongoing investigations or system issues in the SOC log. |
| **2** | SOC Analyst | **Continuous Alert Monitoring**: Monitor SIEM dashboard for real-time security alerts. Acknowledge new alerts within **[Timeframe, e.g., 5 minutes]** of generation and begin initial triage procedures. |
| **3** | SOC Analyst | **Alert Triage and Classification**: For each new alert, perform initial analysis to determine alert validity and severity. Classify alerts as: **Critical** (immediate escalation), **High** (investigate within 30 minutes), **Medium** (investigate within 2 hours), **Low** (investigate within 24 hours), or **False Positive** (document and close). |
| **4** | SOC Analyst | **Initial Investigation**: For valid alerts, gather additional context by searching related logs, checking user activity patterns, and correlating with threat intelligence feeds. Document findings in the SIEM case management system. |
| **5** | SOC Analyst | **Critical Alert Escalation**: For Critical severity alerts, immediately notify the Security Officer and Incident Response Team via phone and email. Initiate incident response procedures per RES-PROC-001. |
| **6** | SOC Analyst | **High Priority Investigation**: For High severity alerts, conduct detailed log analysis within 30 minutes. Review user authentication history, data access patterns, and system activities. Escalate to Security Team Lead if indicators of compromise are identified. |
| **7** | Security Team Lead | **Advanced Analysis**: For escalated alerts, perform deep analysis using advanced correlation rules, behavioral analytics, and threat hunting techniques. Coordinate with System Administrators for additional data collection if required. |
| **8** | Security Team Lead | **Incident Determination**: Based on investigation findings, determine if the alert represents a confirmed security incident. If confirmed, activate incident response procedures and notify the Security Officer. If not confirmed, document findings and close the alert. |
| **9** | SOC Analyst | **Medium/Low Priority Processing**: For Medium and Low priority alerts, complete investigation within specified timeframes. Document analysis results and resolution actions in the SIEM system. Identify patterns that may indicate larger security issues. |
| **10** | SOC Analyst | **False Positive Management**: For alerts determined to be false positives, document the root cause and coordinate with Security Team Lead to tune detection rules. Update SIEM configurations to reduce future false positives while maintaining detection capability. |
| **11** | System Administrator | **Log Source Health Monitoring**: Monitor log collection systems for failures, capacity issues, or configuration problems. Address any log forwarding failures within **[Timeframe, e.g., 1 hour]** to ensure continuous monitoring coverage. |
| **12** | System Administrator | **SIEM System Maintenance**: Perform daily health checks of SIEM infrastructure, including storage capacity, processing performance, and correlation rule functionality. Address any system issues immediately to maintain monitoring capabilities. |
| **13** | Security Team Lead | **Daily Security Summary**: Generate daily summary report of security events, including alert volumes, incident counts, trending issues, and system health status. Distribute to Security Officer and management team. |
| **14** | Security Team Lead | **Weekly Threat Analysis**: Conduct weekly analysis of security trends, attack patterns, and emerging threats affecting the organization. Update correlation rules and detection capabilities based on new threat intelligence. |
| **15** | Compliance Analyst | **Monthly Access Review**: Generate monthly reports of privileged access activities, administrative actions, and ePHI access patterns for compliance review. Identify any unusual access patterns or policy violations for investigation. |
| **16** | Security Officer | **Quarterly Program Review**: Conduct quarterly review of log monitoring effectiveness, including alert accuracy, response times, and detection capabilities. Identify improvement opportunities and update procedures as needed. |
| **17** | SOC Analyst | **End of Shift Documentation**: Document all activities, outstanding alerts, and investigation status in the SOC log. Brief incoming shift personnel on any ongoing incidents or system issues requiring attention. |

### 5. Alert Response Matrix

| **Alert Severity** | **Response Time** | **Escalation Required** | **Documentation Level** |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Critical** | Immediate (5 minutes) | Security Officer, Incident Response Team | Detailed incident report |
| **High** | 30 minutes | Security Team Lead if IOCs identified | Comprehensive investigation notes |
| **Medium** | 2 hours | Team Lead for pattern analysis | Standard investigation summary |
| **Low** | 24 hours | None unless part of larger pattern | Basic resolution documentation |
| **Informational** | Best effort | None | Log entry only |

### 6. Log Analysis Procedures

#### 6.1 Real-Time Monitoring Requirements

**Continuous Monitoring:**
- Monitor SIEM dashboard continuously during business hours
- Automated after-hours monitoring with on-call escalation
- Review all Critical and High priority alerts within response timeframes
- Maintain situational awareness of current threat landscape

**Correlation Analysis:**
- Cross-reference alerts with external threat intelligence
- Identify patterns across multiple systems and users
- Correlate failed authentication attempts with successful access
- Analyze data access patterns for unusual behavior

#### 6.2 Incident Investigation Workflow

**Initial Analysis Steps:**
1. Gather alert details and associated log entries
2. Identify affected systems, users, and data
3. Check user authentication and authorization history
4. Review network connection and data transfer activities
5. Correlate with known attack patterns and indicators

**Deep Analysis Procedures:**

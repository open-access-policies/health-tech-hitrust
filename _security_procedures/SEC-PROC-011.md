# Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Assessment Procedures (SEC-PROC-011)

**Document Classification**: Internal Use Only  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Effective Date**: **[Date]**  
**Review Date**: **[Annual Review Date]**  
**Document Owner**: **[Information Security Officer]**

## 1. Purpose

This procedure establishes comprehensive penetration testing and vulnerability assessment processes to identify security weaknesses in systems handling electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) and other sensitive data. This procedure ensures systematic security testing, proper remediation of identified vulnerabilities, and compliance with regulatory requirements for security assessment and validation.

## 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all **[Company Name]** information systems, networks, applications, and infrastructure components, including:
- Production, staging, and development environments
- Web applications and mobile applications handling sensitive data
- Network infrastructure and security controls
- Wireless networks and remote access systems
- Cloud services and third-party integrations
- Physical security controls and facility access systems

## 3. Overview

Security assessment requires both automated vulnerability scanning and manual penetration testing to identify security weaknesses. This includes quarterly vulnerability assessments, annual penetration testing, and targeted testing following significant system changes. All testing activities must be carefully planned to minimize business impact while ensuring comprehensive security validation.

## 4. Procedure

| **Step** | **Who** | **What** |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| **1** | **Information Security Officer** | Develop annual penetration testing plan identifying scope, methodology, timeline, and resource requirements for comprehensive security assessment |
| **2** | **Information Security Officer** | Engage qualified third-party penetration testing vendor with **[Required Certifications, e.g., CISSP, CEH, OSCP]** and healthcare industry experience |
| **3** | **Penetration Testing Team** | Conduct pre-testing reconnaissance to identify external-facing systems, network ranges, and application attack surfaces |
| **4** | **Penetration Testing Team** | Perform automated vulnerability scanning using **[Scanning Tools, e.g., Nessus, Qualys, OpenVAS]** across all in-scope systems |
| **5** | **Penetration Testing Team** | Execute network penetration testing including external perimeter testing, internal network lateral movement, and wireless network security assessment |
| **6** | **Penetration Testing Team** | Conduct web application security testing using **[Testing Methodology, e.g., OWASP Testing Guide]** for all applications handling sensitive data |
| **7** | **Penetration Testing Team** | Perform social engineering assessment including phishing simulation, physical security testing, and employee security awareness validation |
| **8** | **Penetration Testing Team** | Test cloud infrastructure security including IAM controls, storage security, network configurations, and container security |
| **9** | **Penetration Testing Team** | Document all identified vulnerabilities with risk ratings using **[Risk Rating System, e.g., CVSS v3.1]** and exploitation evidence |
| **10** | **Information Security Officer** | Review penetration testing findings and prioritize remediation based on risk level, exploit complexity, and business impact |
| **11** | **System Administrators** | Remediate critical and high-risk vulnerabilities within **[Duration, e.g., 30 days]** of testing completion |
| **12** | **System Administrators** | Address medium-risk vulnerabilities within **[Duration, e.g., 90 days]** and low-risk vulnerabilities within **[Duration, e.g., 180 days]** |
| **13** | **Penetration Testing Team** | Conduct validation testing to confirm successful remediation of all critical and high-risk vulnerabilities |
| **14** | **Information Security Officer** | Generate executive summary report with risk metrics, remediation status, and security posture improvements for senior management |
| **15** | **Compliance Officer** | Maintain penetration testing reports and remediation documentation for minimum **[Retention Period, e.g., 3 years]** for audit compliance |
| **16** | **Information Security Officer** | Conduct quarterly vulnerability assessments using automated scanning tools with monthly scan result reviews |
| **17** | **Information Security Officer** | Perform targeted penetration testing within **[Duration, e.g., 30 days]** of significant system changes, new application deployments, or security incidents |

## 5. Standards Compliance

This procedure addresses the following regulatory and compliance requirements:

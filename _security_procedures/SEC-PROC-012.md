# Threat Intelligence and Security Information Sharing Procedures (SEC-PROC-012)

**Document Classification**: Internal Use Only  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Effective Date**: **[Date]**  
**Review Date**: **[Annual Review Date]**  
**Document Owner**: **[Information Security Officer]**

## 1. Purpose

This procedure establishes comprehensive threat intelligence collection, analysis, and sharing processes to enhance security posture and incident response capabilities for systems handling electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). This procedure ensures proactive threat detection, intelligence-driven security controls, and appropriate information sharing with industry partners and regulatory bodies.

## 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all threat intelligence activities within **[Company Name]**, including:
- External threat intelligence feeds and security information sources
- Internal security event analysis and threat pattern identification
- Industry threat intelligence sharing and collaboration
- Threat hunting and proactive security analysis
- Integration of threat intelligence with security controls and incident response
- Information sharing with law enforcement and regulatory agencies

## 3. Overview

Threat intelligence management requires systematic collection, analysis, and dissemination of security threats relevant to healthcare organizations. This includes consuming external threat feeds, analyzing internal security data, conducting threat hunting activities, and sharing sanitized threat information with appropriate stakeholders. All intelligence activities must protect sensitive organizational information while enhancing collective security.

## 4. Procedure

| **Step** | **Who** | **What** |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| **1** | **Threat Intelligence Analyst** | Subscribe to healthcare-specific threat intelligence feeds including **[Threat Feeds, e.g., HHS HCCIC, FBI IC3, MS-ISAC]** |
| **2** | **Threat Intelligence Analyst** | Configure automated ingestion of threat indicators including IoCs, TTPs, and vulnerability information into **[Threat Intelligence Platform]** |
| **3** | **Threat Intelligence Analyst** | Collect internal security data from SIEM, IDS/IPS, endpoint detection, and vulnerability scanners for threat pattern analysis |
| **4** | **Threat Intelligence Analyst** | Perform daily analysis of threat intelligence feeds to identify threats relevant to healthcare sector and organizational infrastructure |
| **5** | **Threat Intelligence Analyst** | Correlate external threat indicators with internal security events to identify potential compromise or targeted attack activity |
| **6** | **Security Operations Center** | Integrate threat intelligence indicators into security monitoring tools for automated detection and alerting |
| **7** | **Threat Hunting Team** | Conduct weekly proactive threat hunting using intelligence-driven hypotheses to identify advanced persistent threats |
| **8** | **Threat Intelligence Analyst** | Generate weekly threat intelligence briefings for security team including emerging threats, attack trends, and recommended countermeasures |
| **9** | **Information Security Officer** | Review and approve threat intelligence sharing with external partners ensuring protection of sensitive organizational information |
| **10** | **Threat Intelligence Analyst** | Share sanitized threat indicators with **[Sharing Partners, e.g., HC3, industry peers]** through secure information sharing platforms |
| **11** | **Incident Response Team** | Leverage threat intelligence during incident response to understand attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) |
| **12** | **Threat Intelligence Analyst** | Analyze security incidents to extract threat intelligence including new indicators, attack methods, and defensive recommendations |
| **13** | **Vulnerability Management Team** | Prioritize vulnerability remediation based on threat intelligence indicating active exploitation in healthcare sector |
| **14** | **Security Architecture Team** | Update security controls and monitoring rules based on threat intelligence findings and emerging attack techniques |
| **15** | **Information Security Officer** | Generate monthly threat intelligence reports for senior management including risk assessment and recommended security investments |
| **16** | **Compliance Officer** | Maintain threat intelligence records and sharing documentation for minimum **[Retention Period, e.g., 2 years]** for audit compliance |
| **17** | **Information Security Officer** | Conduct quarterly threat intelligence program assessment and update procedures based on evolving threat landscape and organizational needs |

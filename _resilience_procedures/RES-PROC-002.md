### 1. Purpose

To guide the Privacy Officer and Incident Response Team through the formal risk assessment mandated to determine if a security incident qualifies as a notifiable breach under the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule.

### 2. Scope

This procedure applies to any security incident involving the potential compromise of electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI).

### 3. Overview

This procedure details the steps for conducting a formal risk assessment to determine the probability that ePHI has been compromised, in accordance with the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule.

### 4. Procedure

| **Step** | **Who**                      | **What**                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**    | Privacy Officer / IRT        | Determine if the security incident involves Protected Health Information (PHI) or electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI).                                                                                                   |
| **2**    | Privacy Officer / IRT        | Assess the probability that the PHI/ePHI has been compromised by evaluating the following factors: <br> - The nature and extent of the PHI involved. <br> - The unauthorized person who used the PHI or to whom the disclosure was made. <br> - Whether the PHI was actually acquired or viewed. <br> - The extent to which the risk to the PHI has been mitigated. |
| **3**    | Privacy Officer              | Document the complete risk assessment findings and the final rationale for the determination (i.e., whether it is a notifiable breach or not) on the HIPAA Breach Risk Assessment form.                                            |
